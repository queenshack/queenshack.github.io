                <h4><b>WHAT</b></h4>
                <p>QueensHack is the first student-run hackathon in Queens, NY, led by a group of dedicated high school and college students striving to promote an interest in computer science. Over the course of 24-hours, participants will create awesome projects and showcase their creativity. Beginners and experts alike will have the opportunity to work together to improve their skills and impress the judges, culminating in an awards ceremony. Join us for a weekend of skill building, teamwork, and fun!</p>
                <h4><b>WHY</b></h4>
                <p>Ever had the itch to create something that would leave everyone in awe? Whether you want to create the next Facebook or boot up your very own J.A.R.V.I.S., hackathons are the best place to start. Youâ€™ll have access to beginner-friendly workshops in the beginning, and mentors throughout the event so even if you do get stuck at some line of code, weâ€™ll help you get back up and running ASAP so you can make your dream apps come to reality. If you get tired from coding, weâ€™ll have side events and food refuels to keep you active and entertained. Or if you want to brag to your friends about attending QueensHack, weâ€™ll give out free swag (t-shirts, stickers etc.) Basically, it will be a great learning experience for you and you will be sharing it with friends, both new and old. Oh, and did we mention free food? :)</p>

                <b>What is a hackathon?</b>
                <p>A hackathon is essentially an invention marathon. Think of it as a science fair but you create your project at the event. While at the hackathon, youâ€™re making new friends, learning new skills, and building something amazing for a chance to win amazing prizes. If youâ€™re still unsure, please check out <a href="https://mlh.io/parent-hackathon-guide">this guide</a> and <a href="http://thecodingdiaries.com/why-you-should-go-to-a-hackathon/">this list</a>.</p>
                <b>Can I work on a previous project?</b>
                <p>We intend on making QueensHack a fair hackathon for all and as such working on and subsequently submitting old projects will not be allowed.</p>
                <b>How much do I have to pay in order to attend?</b>
                <p>QueensHack is completely FREE! We will provide you with food, drinks, area to sleep and of course high speed internet access.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col s4">
                <b>Who can apply to QueensHack?</b>
                <p>Any middle school or high school student within the United States is welcome to apply.</p>
                <b>What do I need to bring?</b>
                <p>You need to bring a laptop, charger, school ID, a sleeping bag (if youâ€™re staying overnight) and a healthy attitude to learn and build!</p>
                <b>Can I work with a team?</b>
                <p>Absolutely! We will have a short introduction session where you can pitch your own idea or listen to othersâ€™ and work with them. However, it is completely fine if you do not have an idea beforehand since initial idea pitches are completely optional (but highly recommended!). The maximum amount of people in any team is four.</p>
                <b>Do I have to stay up all night coding?</b>
                <p>No! In fact we recommend sleeping or taking naps throughout the hackathon so you donâ€™t feel tired. We will be providing a separate sleeping area but you are free to leave and come back later.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col s4">
                <b>What If I donâ€™t know how to code?</b>
                <p>You don't need to know how to code! We will be having multiple workshops for beginners who don't know a single line of code. Just bring yourself and we will help you as much as possible.</p>
                <b>How do I get there?</b>
                <p>QueensHack is hosted at the historic Falchi Building in Long Island City (space provided to us with ðŸ’— from Coalition4Queens). Nearby transit includes the Q39, Q60, Q32, Q67 buses and 7, E, M, R, and G trains. <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/3BntGM3TLoq">Click here</a> for directions.</p>
                <b>What if I have a different question?</b>
