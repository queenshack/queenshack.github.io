            <b>What is a hackathon?</b>
            <p>A hackathon is essentially an invention marathon. Think of it as a science fair but you create your project at the event. While at the hackathon, youâ€™re making new friends, learning new skills, and building something amazing for a chance to win amazing prizes. If youâ€™re still unsure, please check out <a href="https://mlh.io/parent-hackathon-guide">this guide</a>.</p>
            <b>Can I work on a previous project?</b>
            <p>We intend on making QueensHack a fair hackathon for all and as such working on and subsequently submitting old projects will not be allowed.</p>
            <b>How much do I have to pay in order to attend?</b>
            <p>QueensHack is completely FREE! We will provide you with food, drinks, area to sleep and of course high speed internet access.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col s4">
        	<b>Who can apply to QueensHack?</b>
        	<p>Any middle school or high school student within the United States is welcome to apply.</p>
            <b>What do I need to bring?</b>
            <p>You need to bring a laptop, charger, school ID, a sleeping bag (if youâ€™re staying overnight) and a healthy attitude to learn and build!</p>
            <b>Can I work with a team?</b>
            <p>Absolutely! We will have a short introduction session where you can pitch your own idea or listen to othersâ€™ and work with them. However, it is completely fine if you do not have an idea beforehand since initial idea pitches are completely optional (but highly recommended!). The maximum amount of people in any team is four.</p>

        <div class="col s4">
            <b>What If I donâ€™t know how to code?</b>
            <p>You don't need to know how to code! We will be having multiple workshops for beginners who don't know a single line of code. Just bring yourself and we will help you as much as possible.</p>
